# Email-Spam-Classification-DecisionTree

In this notebook, we will explore and analyze the Email Spam Classification Dataset using decision trees. This project aims to build a machine learning model that can distinguish between spam and non-spam (ham) emails.

Dataset Overview

The Email Spam Classification Dataset contains various features derived from email content. The primary objective is to classify emails as either spam or not spam based on these features. The features in the dataset might include:

Email Content Features: Words, phrases, or statistical metrics derived from email texts.

Metadata Features: Information such as the sender's address, email subject, etc.

The goal is to preprocess the data, train a decision tree classifier, and evaluate the model’s performance in detecting spam emails.

Objective

Data Preprocessing: Handle missing values, encode text features, and prepare the data for modeling.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Examine the distribution of features and their relationships to the target variable.
Model Building: Implement a decision tree classifier to predict spam versus non-spam emails.
Model Evaluation: Assess the classifier’s performance using metrics like accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.
Tools and Libraries

We will use the following tools and libraries:

Python: Programming language

Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis

NumPy: Numerical computations

Matplotlib/Seaborn: Data visualization

Scikit-learn: Machine learning library for model building and evaluation

Let’s dive into the dataset and start our journey towards building an effective spam classification model!
